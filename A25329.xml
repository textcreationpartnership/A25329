            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GRreat was the goodneſs of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saviours Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, that he ſent down cloven Tongues from Heaven, like as fire upon his Apoſtles; which was a viſible ſign of thoſe inviſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifts of the Spirit, poured down abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly upon them for the ſervice of the Church, and the enlightening of the World with the knowledg of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt; and that, even after
<pb facs="tcp:65040:3"/>the Nations of the Earth had ſo many Ages ſate in darkneſs, and in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, a dark Cloud of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous &amp; Heatheniſh errours and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions having over-ſpread the face of the whole Earth, inſomuch, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men and Women, Adulterers and Adultereſſes, Stocks, Stones, and other Creatures were miſtaken for Gods and Goddeſſes.</p>
            <p>The times of this Ignorance (as the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Act. 17.30.)</hi> were woful; but then let us ſee the goodneſs of the Lord, who reſtored the light in ſo plentiful a manner, that, as that Cloud which <hi>Elijah's</hi> Servant ſaw at the firſt riſe up like a man's hand, had in ſhort time over-ſpread the Heavens; ſo that little Lamp, which at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into the hand of <hi>Adam,</hi> gave light to his Houſe and Family, became now like the Sun in the Firmament, and ſhined to all Nations; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God being plentifully diſperſed all abroad, as the Sun-beams diffuſed through the whole body of the ayr.</p>
            <p>But then again; that evil Angel of the bottomleſs pit, ſent out a ſmoak in the Ages following, which darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:65040:3"/>the face of the Heavens, and the light of the Church. The Devil raiſed up divers Inſtruments, not only open and notorious Hereticks, but thoſe (of all others moſt dangerous) who cloſely promoted the myſtery of Iniquity, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſing their ſecret workings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had lifted up Antichriſt into his Chair of Peſtilence, and by degrees corrupted the ſimplicity of the Truth, darkning the knowledg of Chriſt with corrupt traditions, errours, contrary to the Faith, defaceing the glory of Chriſt, his full ſatisfaction and perfect merit, with their own merit and works of ſupererogation, and pretended Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Church, joyning with Chriſt other Mediators, and finding other ways to Heaven, which the Holy Ghoſt never taught, the Goſpel of Chriſt never mentioned. So that we may as truly ſay of them, as of the Heathens, <hi>Profeſſing themſelves Wiſe, they became Fools:</hi> Fooliſhly bragging of an infallibility nailed to their Popes Chair, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to erre, or be deceived; they fell into groſs and monſtrous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and led many thouſands away
<pb facs="tcp:65040:4"/>by their ſtrong deluſions to deſtruction, who had pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>The Romaniſts have uſed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of lyes, and cunningly deviſed fables for the maintenance of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and the defence of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed truths, as alſo for the defacing and blemiſhing of the undoubted truth of God. They uſed not only fabulous ſpecches, but alſo fabulous actions too, <hi>viz.</hi> lying wonders. How many falſe miracles have they hatched for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Religion, their Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Praying for the Dead, Invocation of Saints, Tranſubſtantiation, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Would not theſe much trouble many weak minds, had not the ſpirit of God expreſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that this ſhould be the practice of Antichriſt, that man of ſin, whoſe coming ſhould be with ſignes and lying wonders, and all deceiveableneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs in them that periſh, <hi>2 Theſ. 2.</hi> So that that which they make uſe of to prove their Religion by, when they want proofs in the Word of God, we are taught by the word to make
<pb facs="tcp:65040:4"/>uſe of as a proof, that their Pope is the very Antichriſt, and they the followers of the Beaſt. What ſhameful lyes do they bring alſo to prove their Tenets that are in Controverſie? How do they abuſe Scripture, and as much as in them lyeth, put lies into the mouth of the holy ſpirit of truth for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their falſe doctrine? for what is it elſe, when men will wickedly go about to make the Scripture ſpeak that, which the Spirit, who endited it, never meant, wilfully perverting plain Texts of the Word to ſerve their baſe ends, and to confirm thoſe falſhoods which they have learned from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lyes: On the other ſide, how many wicked Tales have they deviſed to ſuppreſs &amp; deface the Truth? That edious lye concerning <hi>Luthers</hi> death, and that of <hi>Beza</hi>'s death, and falling from the Truth to Popery, caſt abroad in his life-time, which himſelf lived to confute to their ſhame; what doth it but ſhew by what Spirit they are led? what ſhameful lyes have they deviſed againſt many other ſpecial Inſtruments of God's Glory? They hope (it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) that ſome will be found ſo fooliſh,
<pb facs="tcp:65040:5"/>as to believe their loudeſt lies; yea, do not many of them maintain lying as lawful for defence of Religion? that Faith is not to be kept with thoſe whom they call Hereticks? and that Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation (a more cleanly kind of lying) is lawful? inſomuch, that when <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> one of the Powder-Traitors, <hi>in articulo mortis,</hi> lying on his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Tower, denied by ſolemn Oath what he knew to be moſt true, to ſave the life and credit of <hi>Garnet</hi> the Superiour of the Engliſh <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and a man of great account among them; and when the thing was proved mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, and <hi>Garnet</hi> was asked what he thought of his caſe, he ſaid, he knew not, unleſs Equivocation might excuſe him. But if their doctrine be true, it cannot want truth to defend it: if, falſe (as it is) all the lyes in Hell will not hold it up againſt the power of Truth, no more than the darkneſs which ſilleth the ayr at night can reſiſt the Sun-beams at his riſing; for as darkneſs is but a ſhadow, and ſo cannot withſtand the light, ſo lyes are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and fancies, there is nothing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in them, and they are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb facs="tcp:65040:5"/>the power of truth, which is divine, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, and God of Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worthy Sirs,</hi>P</p>
            <p>It is lamentable to conſider what the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Clergy in this Land, did heretofore practiſe upon the Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, ſuffering them to live in Ignorance, whereby they might not boggle at any looſeneſs or wickedneſs of life, that ſo the Clergy might afterward confeſs and fleece them to purpoſe. Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the woful blindneſs that was in thoſe times reigning in the World, when no man might buy or ſell; no man might live without danger of the Popes Curſe, but ſuch as received the marke of the Beaſt in his hand, or in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. It was death to profeſs the Truth of Chriſt, and once to mutter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Errours. It was thought worthy to be puniſhed with Fire and Faggot, when any did but ſeek the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledg of God, though in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way; to have a few leaves or Chapters of the New Teſtament in their own tongue, which they could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb facs="tcp:65040:6"/>was held even a Capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the Roman Catholique Church. For, whiles the Shepherds, who had the charge of Souls, became dumb-dogs, not preaching; or blind Watch-men, not diſcovering danger to the ſouls of the people, or preaching per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things to lead men from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Salvation, leſt any ſhould (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills) get light from the Word by reading the Scriptures in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and be able to eſpie their falſe dealings, they took a moſt deviliſh courſe to take away the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did. But they (worſe than theſe fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of theirs) did ſhut up the Word in an unknown tongue, that the knowledg of Chriſt might be hidden from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yea, and they taught them their very Prayers in a ſtrange Language. Oh the impudence of Sin and Wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when it hath gotten head, and is some to the height.</p>
            <p>Now here again, we are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Lord's unſpeakable goodneſs in reſtoring unto us the knowledg of his Truth, and in a clear and admirable manner in deſpite of all the power and
<pb facs="tcp:65040:6"/>policy of the man of ſin, and his many Inſtruments, who with fire and ſword, as well as with pen and paper, laboured to maintain his Kingdom. When An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſet his foul feet, and laid his iron-yoke upon the tender neck of the Spouſe of Chriſt, enthralling the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to his Traditions; enthron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in their Conſciences; it was not now the Sword of any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, nor the policy of any deep-headed Statiſt, that reſtored her, or ruined him; but it was the breath of the Lords mouth in the Miniſtry of his Word, which gave life to the Church again, and blaſted the glory of that Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to that Epigram applied to <hi>Luther:</hi>
               <q xml:lang="lat">
                  <l>Lutherus decimum confecit ſtrage leonem;</l>
                  <l>De clavâ noli quaerere; penna fuit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Inſomuch, that if the Popiſh Prieſts be not worſe than the Egyptian Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, how can they deny, but this was the finger of God, that in ſo ſhort a time ſo great a light ſhould ſhine throughout
<pb facs="tcp:65040:7"/>ſo many Nations, and that ſo many men and women of all ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, rich, poor, noble, mean, learned, unlearned, ſhould ſee ſo much into the myſteries of Salvation, to which the world for a long time had been a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſhould rely wholly and onely upon Chriſt for Salvation, and renounce all Conſidence in themſelves, or any other Creature, or any device of man's brain; ſhould acknowledg the ſufficiency of the holy Scriptures for a full doctrine of Salvation and Godlineſs, and deſpiſe all traditions of men which are not grounded upon it; defying the Pope as Antichriſt, who for a long time had been honoured above God, and whom none almoſt durſt gainſay, or once mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt, renouncing Will-worſhip, Image-worſhip, Invocation of Saints, and the like Idolatrics and Spiritual Whoredoms, wherewith the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> hath defiled the world. This was the Lords doing, and it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our eyes.</p>
            <p>Yea, and in this Viſitation, the Lord did beſtow greater means upon our Nation, than upon many other. There was no Nation in theſe, parts of
<pb facs="tcp:65040:7"/>the world, but they had ſome means, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe that now cleave moſt cloſe to the Pope, as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> But unto us eſpecially the light of the Word hath been clearly manifeſted, to teach us the knowledg of God in Chriſt, and we have had the Martyrs fires burning clearly to confirm us in the ſame. And this light have we now enjoyed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred years together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Much honoured in the Lord!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly Dedicate to you this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe, Entitled <hi>The Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Popery.</hi> The Roman Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue is not only <hi>ſpelunca latronum,</hi> but <hi>lerna malorum,</hi> a ſink of Sin, of Hereſy, of Idolatry, Impiety, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, Villany, <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> a dead Sea, wherein ſpiritual <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> are not ſunk, but ſwim and flouriſh. Yea, how many Popiſh Emiſſaries are come from the See of <hi>Rome</hi> into this Nation, like the Salmon into freſh Rivers, to beget a new ſpawn and frie of Catholiques a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us? Now if we faſten the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of our judgment upon the firm
<pb facs="tcp:65040:8"/>ground of Truth, it will ſtand ſure and ſteady againſt all contrary winds of doctrine. When a certain Jeſter (ſet on by others, as it was thought) in the preſence of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſpake to a noble man of <hi>Prague,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Religion, becauſe he fancied not the Romiſh ſervice, but was addicted to <hi>Rochezana,</hi> a follower of <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> the Noble man gave him this anſwer: If thou ſpeakeſt of thy ſelf, thou art not the man thou Counterfeiteſt, and ſo I will anſwer thee, as I would a Wiſe man, if by others ſetting on, it is meet I ſatisfie them. Hear me therefore; Every man uſeth Church-Ceremonies agreeable to his Faith, and offereth ſuch ſacrifices as he believes are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with God. It is not in our own power to believe what we will, The mind of man conquered with powerful reaſons, willing, or nilling, is taken Captive. I am ſufficiently reſolved of the Religion I follow; if I follow thine, I may deceive men, but God that ſearcheth the heart I cannot deceive; nor yet is it fit I ſhould be like to thee; one thing becometh a Jeſter, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing a Noble man. This you may
<pb facs="tcp:65040:8"/>take to your ſelf (ſaith he) or report, if you pleaſe to them that ſet you on work. <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected always in a good thing,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honoured Sirs,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord eſtabliſh you in the truth, which is <hi>animi pabulum, &amp; ſponſa intellectus,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> calleth it. Truth is a Kings Guard, <hi>Prov. 20. Hezekiah</hi>'s Cordial in Sickneſs; yea, the bleſſed life is nothing elſe but <hi>gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium de veritate,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith.</p>

In the Euchariſt (ſay they) there is a true Sacrifice of the very Body and Blood of Chriſt, offered up to God by the hands of the Prieſt, in the forms of Bread and Wine.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Every Maſs-Prieſt offering Chriſt to God the Father, prays God to accept of that Sacrifice, and

                  <p>In the year of our Lord 787, a Council was aſſembled which the Roman Church approveth, and reckoneth among the univerſal Councils: there ſate the Legates of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who wrote a Book purpoſely for the defence of that Council. 1. In the ſeventh action that Council commandeth the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65040:39"/>of Images upon pain of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>We hold, that the Images of the glorious Angels, and of all Saints muſt be adored and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but as for him that hath not the will ſo to do, but ſtaggereth, and is doubtful about the adoration of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Images, this holy and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Synod doth anathematize him.</hi> In the fourth Action of the ſame Synod theſe words are found, <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are of equal worth with the Goſpels and the venerable Croſs.</hi> And in the ſame place, <hi>the Image is greater than the Word and the Praier.</hi> In the fifth Action the Council declareth, that Angels are corporal, that there may be a ground for making Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Angels. The ſame Council, to prove the Adoration of Images, corrupteth the Scripture in diverſe places.</p>
                  <p>In the year 869. a Council was held at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which our Adverſaries call the eighth General Council. The third Canon of that Council is in theſe words, <hi>We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that the ſacred Image of Jeſus Chriſt be adored with the ſame honour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65040:40"/>as the Book of the holy Goſpels, and the Figure of the precious Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year of our Lord 1059. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the ſecond aſſembled a Council againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> where it was declared; that the Bread and Wine which is put upon the Altar after Conſecration, is not only the Sacrament, but alſo the true Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: And that not only the Sacrament, but the Body of the Lord is ſenſually, and in truth, handled by the hands of the Prieſt, broken and bruiſed by the teeth of the faithful.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1076. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh called a Council to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, among many Articles, theſe three Points were reſolved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>That there is no other name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, but that of the Pope.</l>
                     <l>That no Book is Canonical with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Popes Authority.</l>
                     <l>That all Kings muſt kiſs the Popes Feet.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The firſt point attributes unto the Pope, that which is attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65040:40"/>Jeſus Chriſt alone, excluſively to all others, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond declareth, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, and the Books of the Prophets and Apoſtles, are not to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſs the Pope approve them by his authority. The third attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth unto the Pope an honour which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles never asked or looked for: but they have been ſubject to Emperours, have paid them tribute, and have appeared before their Judicial Seat: neither did they ever give their Feet to any man to kiſs.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1215. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third aſſembled a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Lateran Church, where it was thus reſolved. If the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lord care not to ſatisfie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the year, let it be made known to the Soveraign Prelate; that from that time he declare his Subjects ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from his ſubjection, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Country to be ſeized upon by Catholicks, that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Hereticks. In that deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Council there are ſour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious errours, as my Author obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65040:41"/>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is an uſurpation of the Pope approved by the Council, whereby he diſpoſeth of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals of Princes, as if the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them belonged to him, and diveſteth them of their Lands and Dominions, without the authority of Gods Word, and without any example of the antient Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Errour is, that it makes eccleſiaſtical cenſures, which are ſpiritual corrections, to become temporal puniſhments: as if a Prieſt, to lay a penance upon a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, would cut his Purſe, or rob him of his Cloak, or put him out of his houſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Errour is, that this Canon abſolveth Subjects from the Oath of Allegiance, which they have ſworn to their natural Prince; and teacheth them to be perfidious and diſſoyal with a good Conſcience, though againſt the Word of God, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths,</hi> Matt. 5.33. <hi>though it were to thine hurt,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. And againſt the Rules and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Apoſtles, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65040:41"/>Chriſtians to pay tribute, and to be ſubject to Princes and higher Powers, although Princes were Pagans and perſecutors in thoſe days, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Errour is, that in the ſame Council, they preach murther and maſſacre, and ſet on the people to extermine thoſe whom they call Hereticks: which is not only againſt the Law of God, but againſt that of Nations: for even Pagan Princes never permitted their Subjects to fall upon their fellow-citizens, and maſſacre them.</p>
                  <p>As for recovering the holy Land, at the end of that Council there is a Papal Bull, but with approbation of the Council. There a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made to all that belonged to the Croiſado, to meet in <hi>Sicily,</hi> to begin that journey in <hi>July:</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people to undertake that voyage, the Pope by the Councils au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority ſpeaks thus. <hi>To all that will bear that labour in their own perſons, and at their charges, we grant full remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſins, of which they ſhall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65040:42"/>have contrition and repentance: and in the Retribution of the Righteous we promiſe them in Paradiſe an Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of eternal Salvation.</hi> What was that Pope? and what that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that could promiſe to Souldiers a degree in Paradiſe above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort? eſpecially ſeeing the Pope and his Prelates were not themſelves ſure that they ſhould never go into Hell? But let us hear the reſt, <hi>But to them that will not go in that voyage in their own perſons, but only ſhall ſend fit men according to their means, we give full remiſſion of their ſins.</hi> Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſame Bull, with approbation of the Council, denounceth to all that will refuſe, and not care for this Commandment, that <hi>they ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him in the laſt day of Judgment before the terrible Judg.</hi> As if the Pope muſt then be an Aſſeſſour of the Judg; or as if he muſt condemn ſinners in the day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>In the year of our Lord 1300. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth inſtituted the Jubilee every hundredth year, in which they that come to <hi>Rome,</hi> for their great pardons, ſhould get
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65040:42"/>full, more full, and moſt full remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins. That liberality is fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Churches Treaſury, wherein the Pope lays up the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of the ſatisfactions of Jeſus Chriſt and the Saints, of which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Pope is the Keeper and the Steward, converting them into a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſaith the forementioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) for thoſe that viſit the Roman Stations.</p>
                  <p>The following Popes, being moved with a fatherly compaſſion to the people, have brought the Jubilee firſt to every fiftieth year, and then to every twentieth year. It cannot be ſaid, what a Maſs of Wealth that Jubilee brings to the Pope, and to the Inhabitants of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and the Sojournings of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that then flock to <hi>Rome</hi> from all parts.</p>
                  <p>The Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt being ſuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt for the ſins of the whole world, it is an outrage offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, when to his ſufferings other ſatisfactions are added; as that of Saints and Monks to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for the pain due
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65040:43"/>to our ſins. By this means they will have God to take two payments for one debt. But their ſecond payment is ſufficient, ſeeing no man can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for the ſins of another; and we learn of the Apoſtle, <hi>that every man ſhall bear his own burden.</hi> Beſides, thoſe Saints and Monks, whoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions the Pope will apply unto others, were ſinners, and had need that Chriſt ſhould ſatisfie for them; ſo far they were from ſatisfying for others, and for thoſe for whom Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>I paſs by the palpable Errour, whereby it is pretended, that the Saints have ſuffered more pains than their ſins deſerved; ſince there is no man be he never ſo holy, but ſtands in need that God forgive him his ſins. No man but deſerveth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, if God deal with him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rigour of his Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth attributeth to himſelf the Power over the Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual of all the world, which he proveth by Texts of Scripture rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied: We are taught (ſaith
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65040:43"/>he) by the words of the Goſpel, that unto the Power of the Church two Swords are belonging, the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and the Temporal: for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles having ſaid, <hi>here be two Swords,</hi> that is, here in the Church, the Lord did not anſwer the Apoſtles, it is too much, but it is enough. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he that denieth the temporal Sword to be in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> power, doth not regard well the Word of the Lord, who ſaid, <hi>Put up thy Sword into thy Scabbard.</hi> And to prove that the Temporal of Princes is ſubject unto the Pope, he alledgeth <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.10. <hi>See I have this day ſet thee over thee Nations, and over Kingdoms.</hi> And he will have that meant of the Eccleſiaſtical, that is, the Papal Power, which, he ſaith, cannot be judged of by any, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>The ſpiritual man judgeth of all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man.</hi> Finally, he concludes thus, <hi>Whoſoever then reſiſteth that Power ordained by God, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God,</hi> &amp;c. wherefore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we declare, ſay, define, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that it is of neceſſity to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65040:44"/>ſalvation to be ſubject to the Roman Prelate. That venerable Pope hath found a proof of his Primacy in the firſt words of the Bible, <hi>God in the beginning made heaven and earth.</hi> Theſe are Laws and Papal Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, pronounced with all the forms, and inſerted into the body of the Pontifical Decrees; which to excuſe from Errour, one muſt want both conſcience and common ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 14.14. a Council was held at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> to reform the Church; in that Council three contending Popes were depoſed, of whom <hi>John</hi> the XXII. was one, for 71 Crimes; among others, for publickly denying the immortality of the Soul, and maintaining that there was neither Paradiſe nor Hell. To that Council <hi>J. Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> were invited to defend their cauſe: a ſafe conduct of the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> was given them, and Faith was ſworn unto them, that no harm ſhould be done unto them: But after ſome form of Diſputation they were ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on and burnt alive. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Emperour made a ſcruple
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65040:44"/>to break his Faith, the Council de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto him, that he was not bound to keep Faith with Hereticks: for which purpoſe a Canon was made in this form; This holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil declareth, that the ſafe conduct given to Hereticks, or defamed for Hereſie by the Emperour Kings and other ſecular Princes, thinking thereby to turn them from their Errours, with what Bond ſoever they be bound, brings no prejudice to the Catholick Faith, or to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; Neither can put any hindrance, but that it may be lawful for a competent and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Judg, notwithſtanding the foreſaid ſafe conduct, to make inquiſition of the Errours of ſuch perſons, and duly to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as much as Juſtice ſhall require, if they obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to renounce their Errours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be come to the place of Judgment, truſting to that ſafe conduct: declaring, that he that made that promiſe, remains not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by it, after he hath done that which lieth in him. The ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65040:45"/>in the fifteenth Seſſion, makes an enumeration of the Errours of <hi>John Huſſe.</hi> The nineteenth Errour, for which he is condemned, is, for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>the Popes and the Biſhops Pardons avail nothing.</hi> That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil declareth, that the Popes Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſerve a ſinner, although God hath not pardoned him, which is putting the Pope above God, ſince he pardoneth thoſe that have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God, without Gods pardon, and ſince the Popes pardons are in force, though God approve them not. The ſame Council takes away from the people the Communion of the Cup. They add, that although Jeſus Chriſt did, after Supper, inſtitute the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament under the two kinds, yet the cuſtom of giving to the people one kind only, which is the Bread, muſt be held for a Law; and thoſe that ſay the contrary, muſt be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away as Hereticks, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly puniſhed by the Inquiſitors of heretical perverſity.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1423. <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth held a Council at <hi>Siena,</hi> where the ſame Indulgence was granted to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65040:45"/>them that would fall upon the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as to them that go to defend the holy Land. Thus Remiſſion of ſins and Salvation is propoſed as a reward of cruelty and popular fury: as if the Pope had ſaid, becauſe thou art a murtherer, and a wicked man, thou ſhalt have eternal life.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1440. the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> aſſembled by the authority of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, defineth and declareth in the laſt Seſſion, that the Roman Church can add to the Symbol, and that the Pope hath the primacy over the whole world.</p>
                  <p>In the end of the laſt Lateran Council you have a thundering Bull againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> who then began to preach: there thirty nine Hereſies are reckoned, the ſeventh whereof is, <hi>that the beſt penitence of all is a new life;</hi> which yet is a choice ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the ſpirit of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. The twenty ſixth Hereſie of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentioned in that Bull, is this aſſertion, <hi>It is certain, that it is not at all in the power of the Church &amp; Pope, to make Articles of Faith.</hi> If this be an Hereſie, we may expect other
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65040:46"/>Articles of Faith from the Pope, and Chriſtian Religion is not yet perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; ſince other Articles of the Chriſtian Faith may be added, ſuch as we know not, and ſuch as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles have never taught either by Word or Writing.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> came, which, having begun in the year of our Lord 1545, laſted 18 years. In the fourth Seſſion it was decreed, that unwritten Traditions muſt be received with the ſame affection of piety and reverence as the holy Scripture: That is, that the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, the Diſtinction of Meats, the Adoration of Relicks, the Honour yielded unto Images, the Conſecration of <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, and of bleſſed Beads, together with many other things, muſt be received with the like Piety, Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence as the Law of God, and the Doctrine of our Redemption in Chriſt Jeſus, contained in the holy Scriptures. The ſame Council can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excuſed of Errour, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing in Seſſion the fifth, that the Concupiſcence forbidden in the Law
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65040:46"/>is no ſin. The ſame Council cannot be excuſed of Errour, for decreeing, that the Latin vulgar Verſion of the Bible ſhould be the only authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, thereby authorizing a thouſand depravations of the true original Text, which are Hebrew and Greek: yet ſince the time of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſeveral Popes have cauſed that vulgar Verſion to be reviſed, and have altered many things in it. <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Jeſuite endeavoreth to excuſe that Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſpeaking thus; The holy Synod would oblige us to embrace that Latin Edition, and follow it in all things, yet not abſolutely, but upon condition, that it be cleanſed and re-purged from the Vices and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which are crept into it. The ſame Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath deviſed a crafty by-way to prohibit the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scripture unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and many Prelates and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in that Council were named and appointed to make an <hi>Index,</hi> or Liſt of Books, the reading where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt be prohibited. Now the very firſt of theſe prohibited Books
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65040:47"/>is the holy Scripture, of which they ſay, in the fourth of thoſe Rules they have ſet before that <hi>Index;</hi> that the reading of the Bible in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Country being indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently permitted, brings more harm than benefit. Theſe few Proofs, drawn out of the moſt authentick Rules of the Roman Church, will be a pattern more than ſufficient, to ſhew to any man that is not reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to loſe himſelf, and that ſeeks inſtruction, that the Roman Church can err.</p>

When our Saviour turned Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wine, there was a ſenſible change, it had the colour and taſte of Wine, and that ſo evident, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Feaſt preferred it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any they had drunk before. When <hi>Melancton</hi> was a young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar at the Univerſity, he heard one <hi>Lempus,</hi> a Popiſh Doctor, who would take upon him to draw a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Tranſubſtantiation and ſo to preſent a ſhadow of it to the Eye, though it were inviſible, yea and impoſſible in it ſelf: but <hi>Melancton</hi> (though he was then but a youth) inſtead of wondering at the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Miracle, admired the dotage and ſottiſhneſs of the Doctor.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:65040:54"/>
                  <p n="3">III. A Miracle is a true and real Work, falſe Miracles are deceitful appearances: many Popiſh Miracles are meer cheats of ſome lewd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, couzening tricks of deceitful men, or wonders of lying ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. True Miracles are above the vertue of natural cauſes: falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles may ſeem to the weakneſs of men to be above the power of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but are not ſo: many of them are effected by natural means, though in a ſecret and cunning way: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them are deluſions of the Senſes. Satan cannot work the leaſt Miracle by the power of his word. No power of the Devil can raiſe the dead to life, which is a work ſimply above the power of Creatures; This Chriſt did with a word, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.41, 42.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The ends for which Divine Miracles are wrought, are always good: chiefly for the promoting of Gods Glory and Mans Salvation. So the Miracles wrought by the power of Chriſt tended to declare him to be the Son of God, the Saviour of the World, that men might receive
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65040:55"/>him, and believe in him to Salvation, to prove and confirm the heavenly Doctrine of the Scripture, to ſeal the truth of the Goſpel, to confirm the Minds of men in this aſſurance, that the way of holy worſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Scripture, is appointed by the Lord himſelf, by whoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power theſe Miracles are wrought: but the lying wonders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Papiſts, wrought by the cunning and power of Satan, are for evil and curſed ends, like their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; to draw people from the truth, to confirm them in Errours, in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, praying for the dead, and to the dead, worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, eſtabliſhing Monkiſh dreams of Purgatory, and the like forgeries and abſurdities. Miracles are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, nor perpetual in the Church. If any bring in a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it behoveth him to do Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: But we, of whom Miracles are demanded, bring no new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

                  <p>THis the Papiſts hold alſo to be a perpetual mark, whereby to know the Church: for they ſay, that the true Church of God wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not thoſe which are endued with the ſpirit of Prophecy: and they tell us, that in every age there hath flouriſhed ſome Prophet in their Church. And for this they produce a few forged examples of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> and Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> a Popiſh Saint, and the Founder of the ſuperſtitious Order of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans, and of ſuch others. It is true, there have lived ſome among them in their Church, which in thoſe days were counted Prophets and Propheteſſes, as <hi>Hildegardis, anno</hi> 1146. likewiſe <hi>Bridget, Catharine Senenſis,</hi> whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckoneth up among others that wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65040:56"/>the Heathen, that ſhe prophecied as touching ſuch matters as ſhould fall out to the Church, for a teſtimony of the Faith of the Chriſtians, and ſo to be counted herein a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs of the Church, rather than of the Heathen. So if thoſe three above-named were Propheteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they were of our Church, and not theirs; for they prophecied of the decay of their Church, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of ours. The Devil deluded many Popiſh Monks with ſtrange Raptures and Viſions, though in their nature far different from thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the holy Scripture.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65040:57"/>perſecution and death for the Goſpel of Chriſt; &amp; this he had from the mouth of Chriſt himſelf after his Reſurrection; and ſo we ſee that the Church of Chriſt is not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Croſs by the Victory of Chriſt, or by his Reſurrection from the dead. But wherein doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelf to be Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick and Dioceſs, and its Biſhop to be its Succeſſor) glory?

And in this eſtate they bragg, that their Church hath continued many hundred years, without any interruption. Could the true Church of Chriſt ever ſay ſo much in any age? May not the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65040:57"/>Church ſay as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Bonds and impriſonment abide me,</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, contempt from the world: <hi>I am made a ſpectacle to Angels, to the world and to men.</hi> This true Kings Daughter is all glorious with in, her Beauty conſiſteth in inward &amp; ſpiritual Graces not in Purple and Scarlet, Gold and precious Stones. The truth is, the Popiſh Church glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in her ſhame: and that which ſhe boaſteth of, is a good argument to prove that ſhe is not the true Church and Spouſe of Chriſt: who do talk ſo much of the Croſs, and make ſo much of the ſign of the Croſs as the Pope and his Followers? But who do leſs bear the Croſs of Chriſt than they? they lay it upon others backs with great cruelty and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, even themſelves; that inſtead of being a ſuffering Church, it is a perſecuting Church; inſtead of giving its Blood for the Truth, it doth ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly ſpill the Blood of others, that it ſhould make any one, that is not fearfully blinded, to renounce it, and to come out of her as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Cage of unclean

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65040:59"/>Faith: That the Roman Church did obtain this Primacy from our Lord and Saviour himſelf: That the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church hath power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, neither is it lawful for any to judg her Judgment: That the Roman Church, as it cannot err, much leſs can it fail: That there is no ſure ground for the authority of the Scriptures, but the infallible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their Pope, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Roman Church. But the true Church muſt be diſcerned by the Scripture, and not the Scripture by the Church, unleſs a man would in the dark ſeek to find out the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle by the candleſtick; whereas he ſhould rather ſeek out the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick by the light of the candle: for the Church is as the candleſtick, and the Scripture as the light or candle. Finally, the Papiſts aſſert, that we are to be ſubject to the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation. So when, in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Opinions, they are beaten off from the Scripture, they fly to the Church, and make uſe of its authority, which is with them in effect the Pope, whom they make
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65040:59"/>the Head of the Church, and whoſe Sentence among them giveth all force and authority to that which the Church is ſaid to define. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Church doth but ſignifie ſuch a Society as conſiſteth of Men and Women: and therefore (ſet the Pope aſide) to be abſolutely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Church, what is it but to be the Servants of Men? which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forbiddeth, and preſſeth his Prohibition with an argument drawn from the precious Blood of Chriſt the price of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore when once <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlaeus,</hi> a Champion of Popiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, ſpeaking for the groſs Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of worſhipping Images, uſed this reaſon, <hi>Quod Mater Eccleſia hâc in parte audienda eſset, cui hoc vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum fuiſſet,</hi> that our Mother the Church herein is to be obeyed, whoſe pleaſure it is that Images ſhould be worſhiped; <hi>Brentius,</hi> a learned Divine, is ſaid to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Quid ſi Pater diverſum praecipiat?</hi> what if our Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it? no Command of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Church on Earth, can bear

                  <p n="2">2. That Faith is but a bare aſſent of the Mind, without knowledg or underſtanding of that whereunto it aſſenteth. That there is an implicit Faith, which is the Faith of ſimple men, who although they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give good reaſon of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, yet it is enough for them to ſay they are Catholick-men, and that they will live and die in that Faith which the Catholick Church doth teach. Now this implicit Faith, which, they ſay, is ſufficient for common Catholicks, is nothing elſe but to believe as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, though they know nothing themſelves particularly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is not the property
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65040:63"/>of Faith ſpecially to apply to every Believer the Promiſes of God in Chriſt, (for this they boldly call pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption) but generally to believe whatſoever is contained in Gods Word to be true.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They affirm, that an hiſtorical Faith, a Faith of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that Faith which juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, are all one in ſubſtance. That the Faith of Miracles differeth only from juſtifying Faith in an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal quality, of more fervour, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and confident truſt: yea, the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> are more abſurd: that Faith (ſay they) which Saint <hi>James</hi> calls a dead Faith, is notwithſtanding a true Faith, and the ſame which is called the Catholick Faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That true juſtifying Faith may be ſeparated from Love, and other Chriſtian vertues.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That Faith doth not juſtifie as an Inſtrument, in apprehending the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but as a proper and true cauſe it actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyeth by the dignity, worthineſs, and meritorious work thereof.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That Works are more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

                  <p n="2">2. That Repentance in the New-Teſtament is another thing from that Teſtament is another thing from that which it was in the old: and alſo that in the New Teſtament which is after Baptiſm, is another thing from that which is before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That theſe three are the true and proper parts of Penance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Confeſſion to the Prieſt, and Satisfaction to God for our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Contrition (which otherwiſe neither ought nor can be excluded from Repentance) is required by our Adverſaries not ſimply in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but they teach, that ſins are blotted out, and ſatisfied for by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They appoint a certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to Contrition, and do teach, that unleſs it be ſufficient, there is no Remiſſion of ſins granted.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In reckoning the parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance they omit Faith, and take away, as it were, the ſoul and life of true Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That Repentance goeth before Juſtification by Faith, and that it is a way rather unto Faith and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the Remiſſion of ſins.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. Some Papiſts affirm, that in Contrition it is not neceſſary to have a formal, that is, a reſolute and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs purpoſe of newneſs of life, but that this is always included in the deteſting of ſin; which implicit or incluſive purpoſe is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. They teach, that Contrition ought to be perfect, becauſe it muſt proceed from the love of God, which is the moſt perfect kind of love.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. They affirm, that Contrition is a neceſſary means unto Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they make Contrition (as a part of ſatisfaction for our ſins, ſo) a cauſe of Juſtification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, not only in diſpoſing and preparing us thereunto, but in that thereby we verily obtain and deſerve Remiſſion of our ſins.</p>

                  <head>Their Errours concerning Faſting.</head>
                  <p>VVE are ſo far from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Faſting, which is ſo often recommended in Scripture, and joyned with Praier, that as Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſanctifieth the Faſt, ſo the Faſt may add heat unto Praier, and bring down the inſolency of the Fleſh. Sobriety preſerveth Chaſtity, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth Luſt, and is a help to Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Our complaint of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church about Faſting, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſhe hath changed Faſting into a diſtinction of Meats. They place their Faſts, not in Sobriety, or Temperance in Meat and Drink, neither in a total abſtaining from all
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65040:72"/>Meat and Drink for a certain time, which was uſed of the Antients, but in abſtinence from Fleſh and white Meats.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They put Faſting among Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Satisfactions, of an exerciſe of Humility making an occaſion of Pride.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Pope hath taken this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to raiſe his Empire, to ſet a Rule to the Markets, to the Kitchins, to the Bellies, reſerving to himſelf the authority to diſpence; having to that effect multiplied Faſting-days to that number, that they are more than one quarter of the year; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him to give Laws to the univerſal Church: whereas in old time Biſhops gave Orders every one in his Dioceſs, without any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Prelat of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Du Moulin</hi> noteth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That of ſins againſt Gods Law, as Fornication, Stealing, and Lying, the leaſt Prieſts can give the Abſolution; but eating a bit of Fleſh in the holy Week is a ſin for which a man is ſent to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or to the Penitentiary. And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65040:72"/>they account that man to commit a more heinous crime, who ſhould taſte Fleſh upon the days forbidden, than he that ſhould be taken in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, or other wickedneſs. And in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> men are in greater danger for taſting Fleſh upon the days inhibited, than for committing capital crimes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the Roman Church he that hath eaten his belly full of Fiſh, is accounted to have faſted: but he that for want of other meat hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a little Fleſh, is thought to have violated the Faſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They lay a ſtrait Yoke upon mens ſhoulders, charging them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of damnation to keep their Faſting-days, making it deadly ſin, yea Hereſie to tranſgreſs them; as one <hi>Lawrence Staple</hi> was perſecuted, <hi>anno</hi> 1531; becauſe, in Lent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Fiſh, he did eat Butter and Cheeſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There are many Mockeries in their Popiſh Lent-faſt. 1. They permit moſt delicate Fiſhes to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which are more dainty than any Veal or Mutton: ſuch as are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65040:73"/>Pikes, Trouts, Salmonds, Gudgeons, Lampreys, Oyſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe uſe to be Dainties many times in the more coſtly Banquets of rich men, perhaps of Noble Perſonages: The uſe of theſe, and the drinking of choice Wines are a fit means (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) to tame the Fleſh. 2. And that theſe Hypocrites may ſeem to faſt till evening, they ſing their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ſong at Dinner-time, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they may freely banquet, and take their repaſt, as if God did not know the hour of the day but by their Service and Singing. 3. In the evening they make a Collation (ſo they call it) with divers delicate Sawees, Confections, Spices, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and Wine; and in the mean time they bear the World in hand that they faſt notably.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In the Roman Church one man faſteth for another, as if a Judg ought to releaſe a Fellon, becauſe his Brother hath not dined, as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man noteth.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That the Penances of Faſting impoſed on a ſinner, are redeemed with Money, and that corporal
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65040:73"/>pains are changed into pecuniary.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That this opens a wide Gate unto Traffique: ſo far, that the Book called the Taxation of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chancery puts a certain price to the Letters of ſuch Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in theſe Words: That a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may not be obliged to faſt upon the days to which he is obliged by the Church, and may eat Cheeſe.

                  <p>BUt the Jeſuits have found many ways whereby to diſpenſe with Faſts, and the uſe of Meats on Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting-days.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They will have the obligation to Faſting to commence only at the age of twenty one years, and that it ceaſeth commonly at ſixty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Father <hi>Bauny</hi> diſpenſeth for this Obligation with Labourers,
<note place="margin">Jeſuits Morals.</note> Vine-dreſſers, Maſons, Joyners, and generally all Handicrafts-men and Artificers. To theſe he addeth ſuch
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65040:74"/>as have any infirmity of Body or Mind. They who complain of pain in Head, Heart or Stomach, and who being empty and without food cannot ſleep, are not compriſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Precept.
<note place="margin">Tombou rine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Tambourin</hi> extends the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for Faſting to thoſe who are notably ſick, though they have fallen into this ſickneſs by their own proper fault: and that the ſame muſt be ſaid of a ſick perſon, unto whoſe Health Faſting might happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce. The ſame muſt be ſaid of him (ſaith the ſame Author) who cannot ſleep in the night for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, unleſs he ſup. The Indulgence of the Church in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to eat at noon on faſting-days, is a Rite according to this Caſuiſt, which its Children may make uſe of againſt it, to the neglect of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Jeſuits hardly leave any Profeſſion which they exempt not from faſting. 1. All Labourers (as ſuch) are exempt; for the Church (ſaith he) hath no intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the faithful of the exerciſe of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65040:74"/>their Trades, and courſe of life. 2. Thoſe who climb the Pulpit (ſaith <hi>Bauny</hi>) every day in Lent are not obliged to faſt,
<note place="margin">Bauny.</note> becauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream toyl they are obliged unto by their Profeſſion. There is the ſame reaſon for Confeſſors and Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who ſpend whole days almoſt in Confeſſion; and for Profeſſors, who commonly aſcend their Chairs twice a day, and continue therein commonly longer than Preachers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Em. Sa.</note> when Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hinders the Husband from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Marriage-duty toward the Wife, or cauſeth the Woman to be diſliked by her Husband, they are to be exempt from faſting.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Tambourin</hi> ſaith, a young Maid that would marry, if, by faſting all the Lent, ſhe notably blemiſh her Beauty, is alſo exempt from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Another Caſuiſt ſaith, that one may be juſtly excuſed from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, when he cannot do it without trouble: as if Faſting were not in it ſelf troubleſome, and were not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to cauſe pain, to ſubdue and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65040:75"/>mortifie the Fleſh. Beſides, they who are moſt averſe to faſting, have commonly more need thereof than others.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It ſufficeth (ſaith <hi>Tambourin</hi>) to the Pope for to diſpenſe with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, that he hath a deſign to ſhew his kindneſs towards ſome perſons who have obliged him. If it be kindneſs to diſpenſe with Faſting, commanded by the Church, it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour contrary to the affection and humanity of the Church to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>

                     <hi>Eſcobar</hi> gives alſo another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to exempt us from Faſting without neceſſity and diſpenſation; which is, to depart from the place where the Faſt is, &amp; to go to another place, where it is not obſerved.

                  <p n="5">5. They ſay, that the Pope can abſolve from the Bond of Vows and Oaths.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Oaths among the Papiſts are taken by touching the Saints Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, that ſo the Obligation of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65040:76"/>Oath may be divided betwixt God and the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Upon the Queſtion touching the neceſſity of keeping an Oath, and whether the Pope can diſpenſe with an Oath made to God, you have divers and contrary Councils, where the Pope did preſide; which conclude contrary things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and reverſe the deciſions one of another. And the worſt opinion prevailed at laſt: for yet at this day the Pope diſpenſeth from Oaths, that is; he takes upon him the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of declaring that a man is not bound to be faithful to God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They hold, that the proper Vows of Chriſtians are voluntary, not of ſuch things which Chriſtians are bound to do in duty, but of ſuch as they may leave undone, if they will, ſuch as are their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Vows of Continency, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary (or rather wilful) Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. All voluntary Vows (ſay they) made by Chriſtians, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, as not to eat Fleſh, not to drink Strong Drink, or to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65040:76"/>live unmarried, do concern the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and thereby men are made more acceptable unto him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There are three kinds of Vows which belong unto Monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Vow of voluntary Poverty: the Vow of Obedience unto the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical Governours: the Vow of Continency.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. They ſay, it is an acceptable Service to God, for a man to give all he hath to the poor, and by Vow to conſecrate and addict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to voluntary poverty. They that do enter into the Monkiſh Profeſſion, do Vow in all things to become obedient to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to follow his Rules and Injunctions: as the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Saint <hi>Francis</hi>'s Rule, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Girdle put a Cord about him, went bare-foot, in Winter-ſeaſon covered his Fleſh with Ice and Snow. The Vow of Continency (ſay they) is commendable and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious in all that do take it upon them: and after the Vow made they are ſure to receive that high Gift of Continence, if they duely labour

                  <p n="12">12. They aſſert, that thoſe that are come to the years of Diſcretion, may at any age take upon them the Vow of Monkery: that Children may enter into Profeſſion of Monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without their Parents conſent, as the Men of fourteen years old, at the leaſt, the Women of twelve.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That two married perſons (the Man and the Wife) may ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves, and vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſingle life for ever, ſo long as they both ſhall live.</p>

                  <p>ALl that is ſpoken in the Church ſhould be to edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.6. but it is impoſſible to edifie by that which we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.

                  <p>I know what they plead for their <hi>Latin Service,</hi> and their <hi>Latin</hi> Praiers, that though it be a Tongue not commonly underſtood, yet it is none of the ſtrange Tongues that the Apoſtle ſpeaks againſt, for it is one of the learned Languages: and beſides, it was dedicated to the uſe of the Church upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Croſs. I anſwer, that the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> are learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages too, and that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65040:85"/>upon our Saviours Croſs, as well as the <hi>Latin:</hi> nay, all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages were as well, and better, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the uſe of the Church by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, than thoſe by <hi>Pilat</hi>'s writing upon our Saviours Croſs. It follows not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was one of the learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, it is none of the ſtrange Tongues; for any Tongue not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is to him that heareth it barbarous, and ſtrange, not <hi>ob natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram vocis ſed ob imperitiam,</hi> as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> noteth on that place.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the uſe of all ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and ſheweth, that they be as Trumpets uncertainly ſounding, therefore they ſerve not for edifying, <hi>in utiles ſunt in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ignotae ſunt;</hi> they be unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo far as they be unknown, for we cannot ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to a Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when we underſtand not the matter of a Praier. I had rather ſpeak five words (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) to the underſtanding, than five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in a ſtrange Language. <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud plus oſtentationis habit, iſcud plus utilitatis:</hi> there may be more oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65040:85"/>on in that, but there is more edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this. As it is the work of an Architect to build up an houſe, ſo of Chriſtians by ſpiritual endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to build up one another: but that which is not for the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſtians, cannot be for the building up of Chriſtians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of no uſe in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>The Pope and his Clergy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound themſelves two ends for the celebration of the Maſs and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Service in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue. The firſt is to keep the people in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and uſe them to believe without knowing, to follow their leaders blind-fold, and to obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enquiring. They were afraid, that even the <hi>Latin</hi> ſhould be too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and therefore they would have the principal parts of the Maſs to be ſaid with ſuch a low murmur, that the voice of the Prieſt cannot be heard. The ſecond end, was to plant the marks and Standard of the Popes Empire among the Nations which he had conquered. The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people believe, that their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt be Roman, as well as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65040:86"/>the Tongue which is uſed in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that both Chriſtian Faith and the Language come from the ſame place. But the chief cauſe why the Pope will not have the Maſs to be underſtood by all, is, that the Maſs contains many things, which would either inſtruct or offend the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                  <p>THe Canonizing of Saints is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and Sentence of the Church, whereby ſome that are dead are judged to be Saints, and worthy of Honour and Worſhip; as to be praied unto, Temples and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to be ſet up in their names, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days to be appointed for them, and their Reliques to be adored. And thus (ſay they) it is lawful, profitable, and expedient for the Church to canonize Saints. This was the Popes own invention eight hundred years after Chriſt, at the leaſt; ſet abroach and continued in Policy, for the confirmation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain idolatrous Superſtitions, which he laboured thereby to advance, and now are made the ſeven Points wherein the Canonization conſiſteth, fetting the new Saints in the Calendar with red Letters.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65040:87"/>Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and in our own, we decree and define, that <hi>N.</hi> of good memory is a Saint, and muſt be put into the Liſt of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of that Sentence the Cauſe is pleaded in the Conſiſtory, and an Advocate preſents himſelf, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Reaſons why ſuch a one ought to be ſainted. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were not ſo ſainted, nor their Diſciples, nor thoſe Fathers, who were called Saints; as <hi>Ireneus Cyprian, Baſil, Hierome, Auguſtine,</hi> as a learned Divine noteth.

Sometimes the degree of <hi>Beati</hi> is obtained for them, which is a middle degree, and an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saint-ſhip. By this means Popes will give their Servants to be worſhipped by the Nations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom: whch new Saints are far more honoured than the Patriarchs
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65040:88"/>and Prophets: for in the Roman Church it fareth with Saints as with Clothes, the neweſt are the beſt, and moſt eſteemed.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65040:110"/>or in the Water, or in hot Bathes: for the Purgatory in a ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean fire was not yet invented. The <hi>Paynims</hi> divided man into two parts, taking the Body for one, and the Soul for the other. Again, after that the Soul was ſeparated from the Body, they divided it into three parts. The ſame that went down into thoſe places called they called <hi>Inferos,</hi> or <hi>Inferna,</hi> they called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> comprehending thereby all that which now-adays they call the Hell of the damned, <hi>Limbus</hi> and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.

                  <p>The Phariſees preached Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Works of the Law, and the Jews were foreſtalled with that Doctrine, which made <hi>S.

Thus may you ſee in the Papiſts their bitter hatred againſt the Preachers of the Goſpel, together with their pretended love to the ancient Doctors: their proud conceit of Merit with their glorious outward Performances: their groſs Idolatry covered under a ſhew of much reverence to the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Jews were moſt ſtrict in matters of ſmalleſt moment; they would pay Tythe of Mint, Annis, and Cummin, but neglected the weightier matters of the Law, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy, and Faith, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.23. So doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerve diſtinction of meats, and amuſe the people about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand petty Ceremonies of Candles, Pilgrimages, Croſſings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let

                  <p>Thus the ſuperſtitious Prieſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews made no ſcruple to hire a Traitor, to ſuborn falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to Apprehend, to Bind, to Smite, to Scourge, to Blaſpheme, to Condemn the Innocent Lamb of God, and to Crucifie the Lord of glory; yet made great Conſcience not to ſtep over the Threſhold into the Judgment-Hall of an Heathen-Judg, leſt (forſooth) they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſſover, <hi>John</hi> 18.28. yet this ſhunning of <hi>Pilates</hi> Hall was no Commandement of God. They made no Conſcience to give a price for Innocent blood, but made great ſcruple of putting it into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, as being unlawful. So do the Papiſts, ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie, forbid Marriage, and yet allow Stews. They are very ſevere in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning abſtinence from meats, which God hath created to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Thankſgiving; yet
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65040:118"/>make no ſcruple to Stab or Poiſon the greateſt Princes (whom God hath forbidden to be touched) for the promoting of the Catholick Cauſe, as they varniſh over their own Intereſt. They will not touch money, nor eat fleſh on a <hi>Friday,</hi> but will take Rent for Brothel-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and allow Prieſts an Abſolution for defiling ſilly Women, laden with divers Luſts upon a ſlight Penance; while they make their taking of Wives to avoyd Fornication, to be a damnable ſin. They are all for Sacrifice, nothing for Mercy. A great part of their Religion (as a Judicious Divine obſerveth) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in meats and drinks, in days, wherein they place both Holineſs and Neceſſity, yea merit and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

They have an High-prieſt after the manner of <hi>Aaron:</hi> they have their Unction and Conſecration of Altars, and of all Veſſels and Utenſils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their ſuperſtitious Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Phariſees miſinterpreted the Law, for which our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And what is the ſingularity of the ordinary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh School-Divinity, but an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated body tempered with the drugs and dregs of human Reaſon? A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> rather than a transferring of them over unto <hi>Paul.</hi> There is more
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65040:119"/>Droſs than Gold in it, more Poiſon than wholeſom Food in it; and therefore dangerous to young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and raw Divines, who for want of uſe and experience have not their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil; nor judgment to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of things that differ, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the things that are excellent, and to hold faſt that which is good. <hi>Luther</hi> complained of the School-men, that they turned <hi>uſum</hi> into <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> all practices of Religion into needleſs Diſputes. In the dark times of Popery, when the truth was almoſt baniſhed out of the world, then was the world full of Scholaſtick curioſities, which <hi>Luther</hi> calls <hi>phiolas illas aureas,</hi> the golden vials of the wrath of God. How have they intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on things which they have not ſeen? The Popiſh Doctors can tell you punctually, how many Orders and Degrees there are among the Angels, their very Names, Natures, Offices and Employments; their Knowledg, their manner of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; as if they had travelled as many years in Heaven, as <hi>Lucian</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:65040:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>did in the orb of the Moon; and can tell as many ſtories of them, as <hi>Lucian</hi> did of that Lunary world: only with this difference, as one ſaith, that whereas <hi>Lucian,</hi> although an enemy to Religion, and to God the Author of it, was yet ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to acknowledg in his Book <hi>de vera Hiſtoria,</hi> his Readers ſhould take nothing for true in it, but only this one Confeſſion, that in it there was nothing true. The Romaniſts will have all their lies taken for truth, and thoſe no leſs than Divine. They can deſcribe Paradiſe, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Hell: they can tell you what the Angels, the Virgin <hi>Mary, S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, S. Paul,</hi> do in Heaven, and what the curſed fiends do in Hell; how many years ſuch a one muſt lye in Purgatory, when he ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thence, if his Friends will pay down ſuch a round ſum of money. But much more would his Goodneſs be extolled, if the Pope would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at once all thoſe his Purgatory priſoners without that ſimonaical receipt of Money.</p>
